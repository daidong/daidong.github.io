# General Info

## Why are we doing this?
We want to encoraging Undergraudate students to participate research as early as possible. So, we are looking for **Sophomore** and **Junior** students.

## Who are doing this?
In Spring 2023, faculty members in the Parallel High-Performance Computing Lab (PHPC) are doing this. We are Tyler Allen, Dong Dai, Erik Saule, and Yonghong Yan. We and our Ph.D. students will be mentoring your research. In addition, Md. Hasanur Rashid (mrashid2@uncc.edu) will be our TA to interact with you diarly.

## How can I participate?
1. Spend 2-mins to fill this Google Form to regiester: [Registration Form]().
2. We will contact you to know more about your background and interests.
3. We will register you in Course ITCS 3050 in Spring 2023 for this course.


## What are the Research Projects?
Our mentors are currently working on list of research projects listed below. You will have the choices to pick the projects you are interested and participlate. You can also propose your own projects, as long as your mentors agree. 

### Project 1: Locality through Unfolding and Recomposing GPU Kernels
GPU Applications using out-of-the-box computational libraries, such as BLAS, often expose inefficiencies due to loss of locality between kernels (i.e. functions). Applications have available data reuse that is lost due to the “synchronization barrier” between kernels. If we can unfold these kernels, we can use techniques (analytical evolving into compiler) to combine kernels, and then leverage locality.

### Project 2: Accelerated MatrixIRLS
Iteratively Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) method for matrix factorization can be benifited by the parallel and distributed nature of the High-performance Computing (HPC) environment. We hope to integrate, test, and benchmark the implemtation of MatrixIRLS into HPC environment.

### Project 3: Visualization for Heterogeneous Memory Access Patterns and Migration
Systems and architectural processes are often very difficult to comprehend and understand. They also do not lend themselves easily to visualization. This project involves developing visualizations that can help us create graphical representations of data access and memory migration over time for heterogeneous systems. These visualizations could improve the understandability of data flow, data migration, remote data access, and overall application access patterns for arbitrary applications.

### Project 4: Machine Learning-based Parameter Tuning in Large-scale System
This project aims to understand the general High-Performance Computing (HPC) environment and the CAPES framework. The student will learn the basics of the High-performance Computing (HPC) environment and Parallel File System (PFS), specifically Lustre. The student will attain proficiency in how to create and maintain an HPC cluster. The student will get to explore how parameter tuning works and acquire knowledge on how to conduct structured and in-depth evaluations.

### Project 5: Understand Job Execution in SuperComputers
The goal of this project is to understand how Supercomputers or Cloud run jobs internally. For instance, how might different jobs be submitted to Supercomputers? How these jobs are scheduled to run? What has to be done to make sure jobs can run efficiently without wasting the hardware? These are interesting and critically important questions to answer. In this project, the student will get familiar with these topics in a quantitive way. We will use some high-fidelity simulators to study how jobs are executed in large-scale environments accurately and efficiently.


### Project 6: Bringing High Performance Computing to Gephi
Gephi is an open source tool for interactive graph visualization and analysis. While Gephi is a useful tool, the analysis it provides usually has simple implementations leading to low performance and high response time, in particular for analysis of high complexity. In this project, we will develop a plugin for Gephi to enable users to leverage existing codes and techniques to bring high performance computing to analysts.



### Project 7: Search and Removal of Redundant Instructions from Compiler IR and Binary
One kind of redundant instructions are those that do not change the operands of the instruction, for example an instruction that adds or subtracts 0, or an instruction that multiplies or divides 1. In this project, the students will learn how to use tools to perform analysis of compiler internal representation (IR) or binary code of a program to identify those kinds of instructions. Then they will explore how to use tools to rewrite the IR program or binary code to remove those instructions.

### 1.7 Obtain Help

For remote teaching, students must get help during the semester. We provide the following measures to help:

-   **Email.** The instructor and the TA are always available for you! Send emails to us!
-   If you have questions that are related to your particular cases, such as questions about your grades or a fine point on a programming assignment that would require you to disclose your entire assignment, then feel free to ask those by email. We may redirect questions that can serve the whole class to the Piazza.

### 1.8 COV19 Issues

-   This semester is new to all of us, we are dedicated to helping. We hope to provide maximal flexibility to you.
-   It is the policy of UNC Charlotte for the Fall 2020 semester that as a condition of on-campus enrollment, all students are required to engage in safe behaviors to avoid the spread of COVID-19 in the 49er community. Such behaviors specifically include the requirement that all students properly wear CDC-compliant face coverings ([CDC-compliant face coverings!](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/how-to-wear-cloth-face-coverings.html)) while in buildings including in classrooms and labs. Failure to comply with this policy in the classroom or lab may result in dismissal from the current class session. If the student refuses to leave the classroom or lab after being dismissed, the student may be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity for charges under the Code of Student Responsibility ([Code of Student Responsibility!](https://legal.uncc.edu/policies/up-406)).
-   For absences related to COVID-19, please adhere to the following:
    -   Complete your Niner Health Check each morning.
    -   **Do not come to class if you are sick**. Please protect your health and the health of others by staying home. Contact your healthcare provider if you believe you are ill.
    -   If you are sick: If you test positive or are evaluated by a healthcare provider for symptoms of COVID-19, indicate so on your Niner Health Check to alert the University. Representatives from Emergency Management and/or the Student Health Center will follow up with you as necessary. Submit a copy of your Niner Health Check notification email to your instructors.
    -   If you have been exposed to COVID-19 positive individuals and/or have been notified to self-quarantine due to exposure, indicate so on your Niner Health Check to alert the University. Representatives from Emergency Management and/or the Student Health Center will follow up with you as necessary. Submit a copy of your Niner Health Check notification email to your instructors.
-   To return to class after being absent due to a period of self-quarantine, students should submit a copy of their Niner Health Check clearance email to their instructor(s). To return to class after being absent due to a COVID-19 diagnosis, students should submit an online request form ([Online Request Form!](https://sass.uncc.edu/services/absence-verification)) to Student Assistance and Support Services (SASS). Supporting documentation can be attached directly to the request form and should be from a student's health care provider or the Student Health Center, clearly indicating the dates of absences and the date the student is able to return to class. Instructors will be notified of such absences.
-   If you are affected by COV19, we will be as flexible as possible to help you go through them, including providing remote learning resources, extending assignment deadlines, or providing extra exams.
